# monomorphist
## a JavaScript performance companion

This repo contains the code running at <https://mono.morph.ist>. It's still early stage / beta software.

The goal is to provide a few online tools helping devs understand JavaScript performance things.

What's available right now is a tool to trace [V8 bailouts / deopts](http://vhf.github.io/blog/2016/01/22/chromium-chrome-v8-crankshaft-bailout-reasons/) by running snippets on various Node versions.

### What I'd like to add:

* A hosted [IRHydra](https://github.com/mraleph/irhydra) instance
* Provide insights, tips, stats

### What you can do:

* Open issues to discuss features, suggest improvements or notify me of a bug
* Via PRs, fix bugs, improve the design, the docs or anything else

### TODO

- [x] Security: Node containers shouldn't be able to network at all
- [x] Live preview of the instrumented code when filling the form
- [x] Dynamically add panes when adding an engine.
- [x] Visual queues of the job status and optimization status
- [ ] Validate function call and function name
- [x] Highlight relevant parts from the logs. Give an aggregated overview, store this aggregated overview together with the job for stats purposes.
- [ ] Fake a job for demo purposes. Make it interesting.
- [x] Implement queue
- [x] Display queue status. Is it running at full capacity?
- [ ] Stats:
  - [ ] how long does a job usually last
  - [x] how long until my job runs
  - [ ] what are the common mistakes
- [x] Kill jobs after 30s
- [ ] In the job logs per node, highlight every occurrence of the function name
- [ ] Sort the node packageVersions by version comparison
- [ ] Compare several exampleFunctions and see what could be removed if printStatus() wasn't defined in the file being profiled
- [ ] Install a few popular packages inside the node containers (lodash, bluebird, â€¦?)
- [ ] use `parallel` to benchmark the server
